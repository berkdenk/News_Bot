330988264,GOP lawmakers attack Walz for ‘sanctuary’ policy at testy Capitol Hill hearing,"WASHINGTON – Gov. Tim Walz and two other governors were attacked by GOP lawmakers who said their state policies toward immigrants promote lawlessness during a contentious hearing Thursday that was short on serious questioning and long on self-serving political speeches.

Walz and Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York and JB Pritzker of Illinois were asked to appear before the panel a month ago to defend what GOP lawmakers say are “sanctuary” policies. But they were given little time to respond to a barrage of questions and accusations that the governors were responsible for violent crimes committed by immigrants in their states

At one point during the hearing Walz said, “I did not realize how much anger there was here.”

And after hours of antagonism, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, apologized to the governors “for the abuse you received” and called the hearing “a circus.” 

At one point the hearing erupted in shouting after Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., demanded Comer subpoena Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Noem in Los Angeles. 

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., shouted out that Frost was a member of Antifa – a loose confederation of anti-fascist activists – and was required to take back her accusation. 

In his opening remarks, House Oversight and Government Reform chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., focused on attacking Walz for saying Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are behaving like the Gestapo and for Minnesota’s decision to provide undocumented immigrants with driver’s licenses and state-funded health care.

“Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets,” Walz said at a University of Minnesota Law School graduation last month.

Other GOP lawmakers also slammed Walz for his depiction of ICE.

Yet in his opening statement, the highest-ranking Democrat on the panel, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, echoed Walz’s comment when he spoke of the ICE’s detainment of Turkish foreign student Rümeysa Öztürk.

“When you compare the old films of the Gestapo grabbing people off the streets of Poland and you compare them to those nondescript thugs who grabbed that graduate student it does look like a Gestapo operation,” Lynch said.

Walz insisted Minnesota is not a sanctuary state.

“Minnesota’s legislature has passed no such law making Minnesota a sanctuary state and I have not signed any such legislation into law,” the governor said in his opening statement.

Connecticut, Illinois, California and other states have approved “Trust Acts” that limit local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE unless an individual has been convicted of a serious crime, preventing the needless detention of people for immigration purposes. Minnesota has not passed such a law.

Walz said Minnesota cooperates with federal authorities “in a number of ways,” including asking the immigration status of convicted felons and sharing that information with the Department of Homeland Security, a policy that is codified by Minnesota state law.

Walz also said Minnesota complies with federal requests to detain an immigrant when those requests are accompanied with a judicial warrant.

“Minnesotans are angry with what they see happening to their neighbors,” Walz said, because they are watching people being “snatched up” and sent to overseas prisons without due process.

Walz said he was “disappointed” that “at a crucial inflection point in U.S. history,” Congress was misspending its time and energy holding a hearing to attack the policies of Minnesota and other “blue” states.

Democrats on the panel, meanwhile, attacked the Trump administration for its aggressive deportation policy, which has snared law abiding immigrants and even U.S. citizens, and for its decision to send National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, which has experienced a week of protests over ICE actions in the state. 

“People are being arrested who have not broken any laws,” said Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas. 

All three Democratic governors also condemned the sending of guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. 

Democrats also pushed back on GOP efforts to demonize all immigrants as dangerous criminals by citing studies that show immigrants are less likely than non-immigrants to commit crimes.

Emmer vs. Walz 

As GOP lawmakers put up posters of Americans who were brutally murdered by undocumented immigrants, whom they say were in the United States because of “sanctuary” policies, Democrats put up posters of immigrant families and children – some of them U.S. citizens – who were abruptly deported without due process. 

Rep. Tom Emmer, R-6th District, who is not a member of the oversight panel, was invited as a special guest and joined the GOP effort to batter the witnesses, focusing on Walz.

“You claim you are not a sanctuary state, but you provide free health care, college education and driver’s licenses to illegal aliens,” Emmer said in an angry tirade.

Emmer also said Walz’s comments about the Gestapo was “inflammatory language that put a target on the backs of federal agents.”

“You are an utter failure. You should not be governor,” Emmer said.

Walz was given little time to respond, but managed to ask Emmer “which of the questions do you want me to answer first?”

Emmer has been on a campaign to impugn Walz, insulting the governor during several recent media interviews. At an interview with NOTUS before the hearing, Emmer took aim at the governor again.

“My reason for not being a big fan is he lies with conviction, and has been doing it for years,” Emmer said of Walz. “He is a complete incompetent when it comes to understanding how business operates, and he hasn’t kept my state safe.”

Rep. Kelly Morrison, D-3rd District – who with Reps. Angie Craig, D-2nd District; Michelle Fischbach, D-7th District; and Rep. Pete Stauber, R-8th District – was, like Emmer, allowed as a guest to participate in the hearing, told Walz, “I’m sorry you were not received more warmly.”

“This hearing is about intimidating and striking fear in the immigrant community,” Morrison said, and not about trying to solve problems with the immigration system. 

Like Morrison, Craig came to the aid of Walz, allowing him to defend Minnesota’s policies towards immigrants. She also joked about the tenor of the hours-long hearing.

“I think if I were a permanent member (of the committee) I’d have a permanent headache,” Craig said.

Fishbach, however, needled Walz about the state’s health care coverage of undocumented immigrants, which has been restricted to children in a recently approved state budget. She also asked Walz if he would have signed a Trust Act had it not stumbled in the state Legislature.

Walz declined to answer, saying it was a “hypothetical.”

Stauber, who has been rumored to be interested in running for governor, also tried to rough the governor up, very loudly. He berated Walz for his misstatement that he carried weapons in war (Walz later conceded that he carried weapons, but not in combat) repeatedly calling Walz a liar and saying the governor “disgusted” him.

Lynch stepped in to try to stop Stauber from yelling at Walz.

“You are hectoring,” Lynch said.

After the hearing, Walz turned to Hochul, who was also treated roughly by GOP lawmakers from her state, and told her that “the ones who want to run for governor yell at us the loudest.” 

‘Unofficial presidential primary’

The hearing, which was scheduled before Los Angeles erupted in unrest, underscored the partisan divide over immigration, an issue that was at the center of President Donald Trump’s election campaign.

Trump has issued executive orders targeting “sanctuary” jurisdictions, including one that directs the withholding of federal funds from cities and counties that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Besides providing support for Trump’s immigration policies, Comer used his position as head of the oversight committee to tear down two Democrats who are being floated as 2028 presidential contenders – Walz and Pritzker.

“Welcome to the unofficial Democratic presidential primary,” said Rep. Nancy Mace, R-N.C., adding that Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., must be disappointed that he was not in the hearing room because he was too busy. 

She then called Walz a “bigot” and a “racist” after the governor appeared perplexed when Mace asked him “what is a woman?” 

The hearing often strayed from the subject of immigration. For instance, Comer pressed Walz on whether he discussed former President Joe Biden’s mental and physical state with former Vice President Kamala Harris when the governor was her running mate.

And Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, berated Pritzker over a host of issues, including whether he believed he would use women’s restrooms and whether the governor ever used a women’s bathroom.

334296908,"Jafar Panahi, Nader Saeivar Collaboration Among Film Projects in KVIFF Central Stage Showcase","The Karlovy Vary International Film Festival recently unveiled a sharpened Central-European co-production focus for its rebranded KVIFF Central Stage showcase. On Monday, the fest unveiled the 14 projects from eight different countries of Central Europe that will be featured at its 59th edition next month. 

 The movie projects seeking co-production and financing opportunities, sales, distribution or festival premieres come from “established filmmakers with extensive festival pedigrees,” including Iran’s Nader Saeivar (The Witness), who will be presenting a project that he co-wrote with Cannes Palme d’Or 2025 winner Jafar Panahi (It Was Just an Accident) who is also editing it, an adaptation of Austrian author and playwright Thomas Bernhard’s novel The Lime Works by Austria’s Andreas Horvath (Lillian), and Hungary’s László Csuja (Gentle). “The selected projects, which are currently in various stages of development, production or post-production, will be showcased through interactive conversations about the filmmakers’ career paths and co-production possibilities across the participating countries,” KVIFF organizers said. “The participating projects will also gain access to exclusive post-production advantages through a generous partnership with industry-leading studios UPP and Soundsquare, while also being eligible for the €20,000 ($23,000) Eurimages Co-Production Development Award.”Meanwhile, the recently established showcase KVIFF Talents, focused on seeking out and supporting talented Czech and Slovak filmmakers and innovative audiovisual genres, will be joined by a guest project from Hungarian filmmaker István Kovács. He will pitch the feature-length version of his Student Academy Award-winning short film A Siege (Ostrom) in Karlovy Vary. The new KVIFF Central Stage event, taking place on Tuesday, July 8, was created by the KVIFF Film Industry Office in cooperation with the national film institutes of eight Central European countries, namely Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. “We introduced this new format to address a notable gap in the Central European film landscape,” said Hugo Rosák, the head of the KVIFF Industry Office. “While emerging filmmakers often receive substantial support, mid-career filmmakers typically have fewer opportunities for visibility and financing, despite their equally compelling projects.”Here is a look at the 14 fiction film projects that will be presented at KVIFF Central.

Warning: dead orcs

SAFARI ON THE OCCUPIED: WEEKLY SUMMARY. VOL 8. 

Weeks go by, and the occupiers keep dying and dying 😊 Here is another episode of our regular program ""Safari on the Occupier"".

This time the title is more appropriate than ever - after all, most of the enemy's manpower in our video is trying to escape from the drones with their legs. In vain, of course. Over the past week, the active operations units of the Ministry of Defense's GUR neutralized 98 enemy manpower, 47 vehicles, 3 armored combat vehicles, 145 fortifications and, in addition, a tank.

We are working. The native land will be cleansed. Glory to Ukraine!

A train carrying fuel for the occupiers was hiat in Zaporizhia

Ukrainian troops hiat a freight train carrying fuel for the occupiers in the Zaporizhia direction.

This was reported on Sunday, June 22, by unmanned systems operators from the ""Ronin"" unit of the 65th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their Telegram channel.

As can be seen in the released video of the operation, several tanks caught fire as a result of the rolling stock being hit.

""The Southern Defense Forces, together with SBU soldiers, stopped an enemy fuel train near Tokmak, and the Ronins from the 65th Mech Brigade burned it with your drones. As a result of the operation, several fuel tanks were destroyed, which were to be used by the russian occupation army,"" the commentary on the published footage reads.

... and a different view

Black soot to the skies - scouts destroyed railway tanks with fuel belonging to the occupiers

On June 22, 2025, in the temporarily occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region, soldiers of the special unit of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine ""Kabul 9"" in cooperation with the OSUV ""Khortytsia"", the OTU ""Zaporizhzhia"", the ""Alpha"" unit and the ""Next"" group of the State Special Communications Service successfully attacked the ""warehouse"" of the russian invaders - they burned tanks with fuel intended for the enemy criminal army.

Another successful rumble, provided by the hands of the masters of military intelligence strike drones, took place on the railway section between the settlements of Levadne and Molochansk. Black columns of smoke and fire from the hit tanks with diesel fuel and other fuel and lubricants rose to the very heavens.

The armed struggle against the russian occupiers continues. Glory to Ukraine!

Saab Has Apparently Fixed the GLSDB and Anduril Made Its Engines Faster and Cheaper

The need for new engines for the GLSDB, operated only by Ukraine, is a sign that this 150 km long-range weapon might be finally working as it should

Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB), a deep strike weapon with a range of 150 km, is showing signs of life after underwhelming performance in Ukraine. Saab has found an important partner to supply new solid-propellant engines to equip an upgraded variant of the bomb - the U.S.-based Anduril company.

As notified by Anduril, its branch enterprise Anduril Rocket Motor Systems will handle deliveries of ""modern, high-performance replacement motors"" in support of the GLSDB system. The company says with a new design, sub-tier suppliers, and novel manufacturing technologies, it can make engines ""quickly, at scale, and more affordably than competitors,"" thus empowering the delivery of GLSDBs in larger quantities for customers....

Oh, goody, greater war-making capabilities. And the Owners get richer.

Makes me wonder about Trump bombing Iran. If Iran ""bites back"" sufficiently, I see this as a way (an abysmally stupid way) the Heritage Foundation might try and get the USA to re-industrialize and bring about those ""good-old-days."" I assume that the death count (accidental and otherwise) in the hastily-erected ramshackle ""America at Total War"" factories will be astronomical.

Ukraine's 93rd Brigade Deploys Ground-Based Drone Armed With Aircraft Rockets

The 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has begun using a ground-based drone equipped with a launcher for unguided aircraft rockets.

The brigade's ground drone unit operated the drone. It was developed on the initiative of the unit's commander, known by the call sign ""Elektrik.""

The project was launched with the removal of a UB-16-57 launcher - originally designed for 16 S-5 unguided rockets - from a decommissioned aircraft that had served as a monument in the city of Berestyn for decades. According to the Commander, the launcher had been on display for about 70 years.

In addition to the launcher, the unit secured 150 rockets, which have since been used in strikes on Russian positions.

Elektrik noted that the drone's deployment caused confusion among russian forces, who responded with heavy fire, including artillery, targeting the area where the drone was operating.

Although the concept was initially met with skepticism, the brigade now regularly uses the drone and it has proven effective in combat.

""We begin bombing in five minutes"" Edition

At this point, y'all know the drill. Let me know what I missed or messed up. For other helpful links, check out Oneiros's list for Ukraine aid links (part 2, part 3), notmyjab's thread directory (mostly updated by turboke these days) and other notables, toraque's improved Russian press releases, danceswithcrows's memery emporium (now archiving Bob Able's coloring pages!), and now Old_Chief_Scott's Boom of the Week. If you're looking for a frontline account, check Medic Zero's substack. This is your Ukraine War Thread update for the week of June 14 through June 20 (Days 1207 to 1213):

Consider this your content/trigger warning. The more territory retaken and the longer investigators look, the more Russian atrocities crop up like this young man who now has to care for his siblings. Add in the explosive (pun intended) growth in drone use and you need to remember to read the comments before clicking links. Rue_in_winter put it well (plus a request and a primer on some choice pieces of Russian education) as did this cartoonist. Stay safe out there and consider practicing good mental health hygiene. It's tough out there. It says something about how much Russia war crimes that even a Wagner musician noped out. The latest news is Russian troops branding Ukrainian POWs. Again.

Is this Israel's greatest love machine?

Some news about MZ's unit. They're doing the Lord's work, but it's a very dangerous job.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meat Waves: The Russian military has suffered incredible losses over the course of this war, almost as many personnel as the entire US military and reserves. So their continued stunning display of incompetence should come as no surprise, with Russia losing even more equipment in Africa. This time a Su-24 was shot down. No word on whether it was part of the Wagner unit running a black site prison for the Malian government. It joins the Su-25 that snapped in half of its own accord over Soledar. And yet the Moscow Midget will insist on a bloody summer offensive that will capture territory measured in rounding errors. With what army, though? They've apparently lost half the soldiers Best Korea loaned them just taking back most (but not all) of Kursk Oblast. Maybe they became rations.

Cadet Bonespur's Lonely Farts Club Band: Trump's dud birthday parade was a low-energy, shiatty gnab gib with low turnout compared to the protests against Mango Mussolini (attended by many Farkers). Not even his brownshirts could save face, and even Best Korea was riffing on it. At this point it has to be a race to the bottom between him and Putin for who stages a false flag attack first-especially now that they're not on speaking terms. Not to fret, Vlad, he's not on speaking terms with the rest of the G7 either. Mostly because he's still your willing, shilling whore. Oh, and of course TACO Two Weeks will decide if he wants to bomb Iran...in two weeks. So much for that Nobel Peace Prize he keeps banging on about, eh? [Breaking News: hubiestubert was right, Trump ordered a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities late on 6/21/2025. For peace purposes. I think we all remember what happened after he ordered the assassination of Soleimani. Service members should hold onto their butts, Jurassic Park style. We all picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.] Russia's still trying to cope with losing all that Nord Stream 2 revenue by concocting crazy schemes to somehow restart it. They won't work because regardless of who owns the pipe, the gas is Russian. The overall Russian economy isn't looking too good. Things are getting so dire that Lukashenka is moving his potato peeling operations even deeper into Belarus. Perhaps they'll squeeze money out of the Iranian officials who are allegedly fleeing to Moscow.

Unfriendly Fire: I'm not sure if this is a pre- or post-drone strike image of Russia's latest cope cage design. Either way, it doesn't look very effective to me, and reports say that other iterations aren't that effective. Given their inability to protect vehicles, it should come as no shock that buildings are easy prey. This week started with a strike on a Shahed production facility in Tatarstan using the homegrown A-22 Flying Fox drone. Apparently it towed a glider bomb to the factory. Then drones went after an airfield in Voronezh and a chemical plant in Stavropol Krai before capping it off with strikes, plural, against the Shipunov gun factory. Almost makes you wonder what Russian air defense doing. Fark all apparently and certainly not as much as Ukraine's AA systems. In return Russia bombed...Boeing's Kyiv offices.

HIMARS O'Clock: Despite all the farmer protests, Poland has trained 30,000 Ukrainian troops. The training is noticeable when you see combined arms videos like this of ZSU infantry working alongside Leopards and Bradleys. Ukrainian high command has been similarly methodical in its oversight of those same NATO supplies. Speaking of, future NATO aid packages won't be so publicly disclosed, but we do know France is giving a new meaning to car bombs with missile manufacturer MBDA partnering with a car company to produce its new long-range missile.

Zelenskyy is alive! VHTS is alive! His boss sounds like a real piece of work. Mimosa's doing well, though.

Tracianne's surgery went well but it's gonna leave a mark. Looks gnarly. (Look her up on Etsy at Dragonflies and Daisies, for if and when she's able, although they're continually trash to her.)

Father_Jack learned about tourist trap pricing. At least he has a new job to pay for the damage.

TheDogDidIt, god bless 'em, will occasionally wade into the filth that is oafishal Russian propaganda. Great to ctrl+f the threads for if you want to see the oafishal party propaganda. And occasionally he channels Roy Batty/Rutger Hauer when discussing what he reads there. He may or may not have needed a change of underwear after this one.

Another one to search for, Wenchmaster has taken over for Public Call Box in collecting the daily news articles for presentation to the thread. Now with even more kittens!

For those new to these threads, a not-so-mini FAQ:

(Aka. Weekend thread warning)

First off, if you don't know what's going on in Ukraine, it's better to get informed about the situation than to make what you think might be a message of support, but that touches on russian talking points by using terms like 'stalemate' or 'negotiations'. If you want a good summary of the background/beginning of this war from the perspective of a Ukrainian civilian see the NHK documentary ""Why I'm at War"" : https://web.archive.org/web/20231127051158/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/video/3016143/. For the perspective of an American journalist who was there during the invasion see https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C__JT13ZnLE

Isn't this over yet? The orange one said he'd end it in 24 hours.
He said that when he wasn't running for election. Then he said 24 hrs from being elected. As well as I know, he never said 24 hours from being elected. After being elected he said 6 months (his envoy said 100 days), and he has since said it could take a year. Which at that point would be more about russia's economy imploding than any 'deal' making.

August 24th?
Ukraine's independence (from russia) day.

The date that russia recognizes as the day that they 'beat' Germany in ""The Great Patriotic War"" (aka World War 2, where they lost 20 million soldiers). They usually have a big parade in moscow to celebrate. For 2023, there was a contest to see who could land a Ukrainian colored drone in Red Square. Also when the orange shiatgoblin has been invited to moscow.

Other important dates:
October 1: Defender's Day
November 21: Day of Dignity and Freedom, (anniversary of the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2013-14 Euromaidan Revolution aka Revolution of Dignity)
Third Thursday in May: Vyshyvanka Day

Why can't I call it 'the Ukraine'?
Well, you can, but it's considered an insult because it's not the country's name, but how it was referred to ('the borderlands') when part of the USSR. See https://theconversation.com/its-ukraine-not-the-ukraine-heres-why-178748 or https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18233844 . Although some of us grew up knowing it by that name and occasionally slip up, insisting that it's fine to use will flag you as an inconsiderate asshole.

Kiev vs Kyiv?
Kiev is the transliteration of the russian name, Kyiv is from the Ukranian name. So calling it 'Kiev' suggests that it's still the property of russia. This also applies to many other Ukrainian cities.

Orcs? Mordor?
The Ukrainians started calling them this, and some russians are proud of the name. It references ""The Last Ringbearer"" where russia is Mordor ""liberating"" the Ukrainian elves. As the russian army likes to send human wave attacks to flush out Ukrainian positions and then leave their troops to die (or buries them alive in mass graves), attack civilian infrastructure (hospitals, schools, playgrounds), torture and rape children and prisoners, and generally revel in their war crimes, many of us (but not all) think it is a fitting name for the invading soldiers committing atrocities; some consider it a backronym for ""occupying russian criminals"". (Look up 'wagner sledgehammer' and 'Bucha' if you want to understand and be sickened, or read bertor_vidas' weekly summary). It's also much easier than typing 'rascist' (russian fascist), the other preferred Ukrainian term for them. I personally use it due to their similar tactics to the game 'Orcs Must Die'

Liquidated?
Translations are imprecise, but the Ukrainian counts are more than just 'KIA'. On 8 Dec 2024, Zelinskyy confirmed this; he reported there were 198,000 killed and more than 550,000 wounded. The ""liquidated"" number had just passed 750k.

It's a person who thinks that peace is so important that we should capitulate to avoid wars. But that just emboldens powers and has shown that they'll do it again (eg, when the world let russia take Crimea in 2014 and parts of Georgia in 2008). Showing that russia is not as powerful as they think could help them in the long run ( https://www.rferl.org/a/timothy-snyder-russia-ukraine-war-victory/33067942.html ) and prevent other countries from invading their neighbors ( eg, China trying for Taiwan ) if they see the world will push back against territorial expansion through wars.

Europe is funding russia!
Europe is buying oil and gas from russia, but at a limit of $60/barrel. This severely limits russia's profits, but also helps to keep the wells open and not flaring (both environmental issues), and keeps the western European economies from crashing even harder than they already have because of this war. There has also been a significant shift of European purchases of LNG from the US to offset the reduction from russian pipelines.

Suspending Ukrainian elections bad!
It's in their constitution. They don't hold elections during a war. You don't hold elections when polling places are targets and people can't vote because they're in occupied territory. Claiming this is a choice is russian propaganda.

Cluster munitions bad!
The Ukrainians have decided that the low unexploded rate of US-made ones are less dangerous to their citizens than unexploded russians. Unlike the orc's use of them for the past year and a half that people didn't complain about, Ukraine is using them on military targets on their own territory and prioritizing cleaning up after them (along with all of the russian unexploded ordnance) if they use them directly. They're also disassembling them to drop the bomblets from drones: https://www.twz.com/ukraine-wants-u-s-cluster-bombs-but-not-for-what-you-think

Mines are bad!
Yes, like cluster munitions they have a risk of being left around after the war. And like cluster munitions, russia has been using them for two and a half years now. The US has specifically said they are giving mines that are self-limiting (either de-activate or self-destruct after some time period). Also like the cluster munitions, Ukrainians have been using drones to drop mines precisely on targets, and they have decided that the risk to civilians in the future is outweighed by the risk of russians right now.

(Other weapons system) is bad! russia will escalate and use nukes!
putin (aka. vlad the incompetent) has shown that he's just a bully that relies on everyone cowing down when he threatens them. He _might_ have nukes, but he's already shown that his military is bluster and hasn't been maintained, and he risks losing his threat if he tries and it doesn't launch / hit its target / actually explode. (now we get to see how https://www.newsweek.com/satellite-images-reveal-russia-failed-nuclear-missile-test-report-1957495 plays out)

(Criticisms of tactics or complaining that things are 'slow')
We agree that if the Ukrainians had more weapons at their disposal, they could probably have pushed back the russians sooner. But they're trying to do this while as few of their people die as possible. So please see this from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense: (damnit, misplaced the video saying 'if we listened to people in the first days of the war, we wouldn't have a country right now')

(criticisms of Ukraine's conscription)
Ukraine's bottleneck is in weapons and equipment for their troops, followed by safe places to train them. They are prioritizing conscripting people who are mature enough to understand the realities of war and make good soldiers. Those under 25 and females can still volunteer if they want to fight, but they're also working civilian jobs and keeping the economy and weapons production going.

(Side-thread) is off topic!
Discussing war atrocities for more than two years can drive people crazy. A few people on here take the Hawkeye Pierce approach and try to inject humor when they're hurting/stressed/etc. Many others in here have various medical issues or whatever and occasionally give updates. If you don't want to see that, Fark has the ability to block a given user.

(Statements linking russia to the Mongol Hordes)
See the index of rue_in_winter's deep explanations of that history: https://m.fark.com/comments/12985072/164190074#c164190074

(Incorrect statements about Ukrainian history):
See https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcP8voanyo and/or https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bJczLlwp-d8&list=PLh9mgdi4rNewfxO7LhBoz_1Mx1MaO6sw_&pp=iAQB

(Comparisons to another war going on right now)
The Fark mods have proclaimed that there should only be one war per war thread, so your probable attempts at trolling will get nuked.

Ukrainians fought with the Nazis in WW2!
See Father_Jack's explanation, as too much is lost if I try to summarize it: https://m.fark.com/comments/13003506/164587074#c164587074 ; for more modern stuff, see https://www.euronews.com/2023/06/20/the-myth-far-right-zealots-run-ukraine-is-russian-propaganda

But what about Azov?
They formed to protect Ukraine in 2014, and have been a regular target of russian propaganda. Azov were declared terrorists by russia in 2022 to screw over the ones who surrendered to end the siege of Mariupol. For detailed rebuttals of russia's main criticisms, see https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yhOaXRNT4oU

There have been many debates about what defines a 'world war', but it's difficult to argue that this won't have world changing impacts if a country is allowed to invade and occupy another country.
See also: https://www.yahoo.com/news/world-war-only-enemies-acting-095554853.html?

We should spend money on (my country) first, not on Ukraine!
Giving Ukraine weapons that we would have to dispose of is actually SAVING money for the countries sending them weapons. And most of the money allocated to Ukraine is going to making new weapons in NATO countries (such as the US) to send to them or to replace the end-of-life weapons that are being sent. In the 2024 US defense appropriations, $24B was to pay the US military. Very little of the support from NATO countries is direct cash, and in the case of the US, it's loans not gifts.

(Other russian misinformation that's been disproven repeatedly)!

Some of us would like a stuffed version of

If you know of anyone selling ones to benefit Ukrainians (either a fundraiser or made in Ukraine), let me know.

Sentient coffee pool?
It has asked to be called ""Caffo"".

French toast?
Soak stale bread in a mixture of egg and milk (possibly with sugar, cinnamon, or vanilla), then cook on a griddle or in a pan until browned.

PS. This is not intended to be a fully detailed explanation of each issue. If you have suggestions on how to improve it, give me EXACT TEXT, not vague statements of what I need to change / add / whatever. And I may not do anything if I find it adds too much length without significant clarification / improvement.
PPS. Be warned that there are a few trolls who post what seem to be informative information but is stuff like videos from known russian sympathizers. Yelling at them has only seemed to embolden them further, and calling them out tends to get the mods involved... so be warned that you can't trust all of the information in here, unfortunately.

A unique painting with an interpretation of a Scythian pectoral was presented in the Dnipro 

A unique exhibition of the artistic interpretation of the famous Scythian pectoral was held at the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum named after D. I. Yavornytsky.

The painting was created by a modern artist using her own technique and covered with 24-carat gold leaf. This is not a copy. This is a dialogue with the past, a tribute to strength, culture, and heritage that does not fade with time.

The author Olga Shypelyk creates paintings for charity auctions. Olga's works have already been sold in 15 cities in Europe and 20 cities in Ukraine, and each one made its contribution to the victory. This painting is no exception. It will be donated to a charity auction, and all proceeds will go to support the defenders. Ukraine celebrates Pectoral Day on June 21.

The gold ornament was discovered in 1971 during archaeological research of the central burial in the Scythian-period mound of Tovsta Mohyla near the town of Pokrov, Dnipropetrovsk region. The expedition leader at the time was Borys Mozolevsky.

Ukraine aid links

A month and a half into the war (day 44), many of us felt helpless and listless at not being able to do more to help, so here is a list of things that we can do.

There are plenty of charities that could use your help, but even if you don't have spare cash lying about, there are still things you can do, so keep reading

If you know any Ukrainians in need or in the war zone, see the the next (part 2) post for links for them.

You can donate directly to Ukraine if you want to help them make more videos of tanks blowing up. (See 'military aid' below)

There are lots of humanitarian groups working to feed the displaced people and even their pets. (See 'humanitarian aid', below and continued in part 2)

And even if you're not in a position to give cash, you might be able to find a group that needs some volunteer help or attend a protest. If you don't have a group in your area specifically helping Ukraine, you can likely still find other worthwhile causes. And there are groups that have tasks that can be done online or over the phone without even leaving your home. (See 'other notes' (in part 3)). Even just calling politicians to remind them that we need to support Ukrainians.

You can call out dumbasses online who are spreading russian propaganda and otherwise spewing toxic crap. (Or join groups like NAFO) And by ignoring or blocking the assholes on here who try that shiat. (Make sure to watch for other threads, not just the daily one)

And you can even support capitalism, and buy stuff made in Ukraine or are fundraisers for the war effort. (See 'buying stuff', (in part 3))

If you're actually in a position where you can travel to Ukraine to help out, see https://www.volunteeringukraine.com (they also list some online PR / NAFO type stuff)

If you would like to sign up to help rebuild the de-occupied areas, go to https://reserve.nads.gov.ua/#

And some words from @paigeinkansas on the need to evolve as the war changes: https://m.fark.com/comments/13507528/175677796#c175677796

This is in no way a comprehensive list. This is just groups that Farkers have mentioned in past threads. (Which I had to start trimming to comply with Fark's 100 link limit per comment before splitting it in two, and then 3). If you want a more comprehensive list, see https://supportukrainenow.org . They also have links to specific groups by country that you're coming from for protests, taking in displaced people, etc. You might also find interesting charities at https://standwithukraine.today/ukrainian-charities/ (404... see https://web.archive.org/web/20250204223252/https://standwithukraine.today/ukrainian-charities/ ), https://www.standwithukraine.how , https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/easy-ways-help-people-ukraine-161200814.html and https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tgc00n/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/, as well as someone else keeping a similar list of things to do to help Ukraine: https://ever-changing.net/ukraine .

I make no claims about any of these groups. I've trimmed a few that people have said might be suspect, but I have no personal knowledge of any of them. If you feel the need to vet them before donating, see GuideStar or Charity Navigator. (Links to them below). Or see Forbes' list at https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/donate-relief-to-ukraine/. To check if a company is legitimately registered in Ukraine, see https://gcs-ukraine.com/en/how-to-check-company-in-ukraine/

If you hear that one of the groups that I have listed is suspect (like the groups that weren't actually doing anything, or expected to get paid by Ukraine then left), let me know and I'll trim this list down some.

If you're currently employed by a large-ish company, they may have a donation matching program. You can check https://doublethedonation.com/ but it's also worth contacting your HR to ask even if they're not listed there.

Brits and such should consider donating to UK charities as they can get 25% 'Gift Aid' matching from the UK government.

If you've gained profits from stocks, consider donating the stocks directly, so they get the full value and you don't need to hold some back to pay capital gain taxes. (If you're using a brokerage firm, ask them how to do it)

Fingerware Error: Belarus Releases 14 Prisoners Including Opposition Politician Tsikhanouski, Journalist Karnei
[gdb.rferl.org image 850x477]

Picture shows RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus with Ihar Karnei, a former journalist with RFE/RL's Belarusian Service (left) and Siarhei Tsikhanouski embracing his wife Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarusian opposition leader (right).

Belarus has released 14 prisoners, including Syarhey Tsikhanouski, who was detained in May 2020 while attempting to run for president against authoritarian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko.
Tsikhanouski's wife, Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ended up running in her husband's place confirmed the release.

You should check to see if your employer has a donation matching program. Some may be listed at https://doublethedonation.com/. Some employers may even be able to set up an automatic donation.

Many charities list how to donate through bank transfers. This may cost a couple of dollars depending on your bank, but keeps them from losing significant fees to credit card companies (usually about 2% of the donation)

There are even ways to contribute online, for the home bound people:

Help Ukrainians practice conversational English: https://mobile.twitter.com/OlenaChek/status/1544689140725325825 or https://www.enginprogram.org

If you're a US citizen, call your congress critters and let them know how you feel: (202) 224-3121. Or if you want to support displaced people: https://welcome.us/become-a-sponsor/sponsor-ukrainians. But you may want to try to find an NGO, as if you directly sponsor them you're financially responsible for two years. (https://www.uscis.gov/ukraine ; So tell your representatives to give them refugee status).

If you would like to avoid doing business with companies still operating in russia, see https://dontfundwar.com/directory/ or https://leave-russia.org . There are also phone apps like Zrada that can scan UPC codes and tell you if it's from one of those countries. If you want to avoid American companies entirely because of the current administration's abuse of Ukraine, see https://www.bankrupttrump.org for alternatives to US companies.

If you use streaming music services, search for Ukrainian artist playlists, so you'll give them a fraction of a penny and maybe find some new artists to support more directly. See https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL7h_otRo2v9j1fPVfVkibCjFbmLlThjx ; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDWKjvgmwda9QwNc9RWOjV_Zr0bS7eCH0 / https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4dRq9Ki2UbE3v1Kf8PRXUH ; There are also artist compilations such as: https://ukrainianresistance.bandcamp.com/album/nation-of-the-unconquered

You can watch videos made by Ukrainians to try to get them a few cents for YouTube or whoever:
Woodworking: https://m.youtube.com/@homemadeinlviv8041/
Cooking: https://m.youtube.com/@lubafromukraine

If you watch cam sites, consider supporting Ukrainians (although some may currently be displaced, others may tag Ukraine to show support because they're from neighboring countries, and some of the most in need of support may not currently have internet access; I don't have any sort of definitive list)

There are also efforts to DDoS Russian websites such as the ""Ukraine IT Army"", but I'm not linking to them to avoid risking the mods removing this whole list.

Also see the official Ukrainian website on ways to support their effort: https://war.ukraine.ua/support-ukraine/(must copy & paste as they break the link checker)

327320064,The Frequency School breaks GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the “195” song featuring the most nationalities,"History made by The Frequency School: https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/437728-most-nationalities-to-contribute-vocals-to-a-musical-recording-single-song
The “195” ofﬁcially shatters the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title

LONDON and LOS ANGELES, June 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — The Frequency School set a new GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title for “Most nationalities to contribute vocals to a musical recording (single song)” with the “195” song on Monday, in a bid to raise awareness about gender equality and to ignite a global movement uplifting people through the transformative power of soundhealing frequencies.

The record-breaking “195” is the first song in history featuring women from all of the world’s 195 countries and using sound healing frequencies and the 528 Hz ‘Love Frequency’.

The Frequency School co-founded by U.S. Grammy-nominated and multi-platinum music producer Maejor, Martina Fuchs, Kingsley M, Brandon Lee and Aaron Dawson produced this visionary, powerful and universal campaign and premiered it during the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, from January 20-24. 

Using the sounds of birds and the heartbeat as instrumental elements, the “195” aims to raise the world’s frequency, elevate humanity, and trigger a positive impact by uniting and empowering women worldwide.

One woman in every one of the world’s 195 countries recognized by the United Nations said one word: “EQUALITY” in her national language or native tongue and sent in her voice and video recording.

The number of women and nationalities participating in the song was officially verified by a Guinness World Records adjudicator. 

Martina Fuchs, Executive Producer of the “195” and Co-Founder of the Frequency School, said:

“It has always been my dream to produce the first song in history featuring every country on the planet. Our vision was to unite 195 ordinary women from all walks of life in this pioneering and groundbreaking initiative to advocate for gender equality and the rights of women and girls, and to help people struggling with mental health issues. Breaking this record is only the beginning: we are on a global mission to make our world a more peaceful place.”

Maejor, Founder and CEO of the Frequency School who produced the song, said:

“The world record is a testimony to our work and the universal language of music. This achievement is a call to every one of us to lift each other up and spread peace, love and harmony. We chose to use 528 Hz which is often referred to as the ‘love frequency’, or the frequency of transformation and miracles. We wanted to promote more respect and fairness for women, as well as deep inner healing and a state of peace. The transformative vibration of 528 Hz can inspire positive action and empathy and people to act more kindly and inclusively.”

According to scientific studies and music theory, Solfeggio frequencies, ranging from 174 Hz to 963 Hz, offer unique sound patterns that promote relaxation, stress relief, and overall well-being. These frequencies have been shown to positively impact mental, emotional, and physical health by generating vibrations that help achieve a state of calm and balance of the mind, body and spirit.

Kingsley Maduka, Co-Founder of the Frequency School, said:

“We’re incredibly excited to set a new world record, and I am honored to have the youngest lady in my family, my 6 year-old daughter, to be apart of such an intentional women empowerment project, focused on wellness. Being a man, it’s important that we do our parts to support our better halfs for the sake of the mental health and wellness of humanity. The Frequency School is such an amazing platform for utilizing, implementing and amplifying wellness tools – working at the intersection of music, wellness, mental health and education is some of the most impactful work I’ve been able to be apart of.”

Brandon Lee, Co-Founder of the Frequency School, said:

“Every one of us enters this world through a woman—women are the very heartbeat of humanity. I’m deeply honored to be part of this project and inspired by the future initiatives we’re building at Frequency School to uplift women’s wellness. Earning the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title will amplify our mission globally, allowing us to create an even greater impact.”

Aaron Dawson, Co-Founder and Creative Director of the Frequency School, said:

“This project is much more than a world record, it’s a reflection of the immense gratitude I hold for women everywhere. I carry deep appreciation for every woman who have shaped me: my mother, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, godchildren, teachers, ancestors, and the many women whose love and existence have given me and the world such beautiful life. A better world exists when we honor women’s gifts, invest in them, and protect their well-being.”

Miriam Moriati, President of the Kiribati Rotaract Youth Club and a Women and Youth representative for OARS (Ocean Alliance for Resilience and Sustainability), said:

“I’m from Kiribati, a small island nation in the Pacific, where our highest point is just 3 meters above sea level. Our women in Kiribati are vulnerable due to gender equality not being part of our culture and traditions. They are often the first to be affected by crises and the last to recover. Being part of this initiative to support women on an international stage is an incredible honor. Opportunities to represent our small country are rare, and I am grateful for this platform to amplify the voices of Kiribati women.”

Sawilanji Nachula, a middle school student representing Zambia, said:

“I am a 13-year old Zambian and live on the ‘Mighty Zambezi’ near the Victoria Falls. I am currently a student at Falcon College in Esigodini, Zimbabwe, where I will start my grade 9 next month. I am both honoured and inspired to smash the world record with so many already successful and soon to be successful members. I doubt I will be able to contribute much myself for now. But I will be sure to promote gender equality as I get older.”

Inspired by the murmuration of birds and nature’s synchronicity, the visualizer of the song includes art elements evoking raw emotions and reflecting the power and harmony of women, and their aspiration for freedom and collective strength.

LISTEN: What kind of a man tortures and murders his own child? On The Case: The Murder of Sara Sharif is available now

By JOSEPH PALMER

Published: 08:00 BST, 25 June 2025 | Updated: 08:02 BST, 25 June 2025

A new Mail podcast series investigates the brutal murder of 10-year-old Sara Sharif by her father Urfan and stepmother Bainash Batool in 2023.

The first episode of 'On The Case: The Murder of Sara Sharif' examines how Urfan, a Pakistani national, left a trail of abused women in his wake while seeking an EU national to marry - in order to remain in the UK.

Hosted by investigative journalist Andy Jehring - who reported on the case from the discovery of Sara's body to Urfan's sentencing to life imprisonment in December 2024 - the episode features an exclusive interview with the killer's first girlfriend in the UK.

Polish national 'Angelika', who was only 17 when she met 26-year-old Urfan working at Burger King, describes a deeply insecure man whose desire to abuse those closest to him often trumped his mission to secure UK residency.

The first episode of 'On The Case: The Murder of Sara Sharif' examines how Urfan, a Pakistani national, left a trail of abused women in his wake while seeking an EU national to marry

Urfan Sharif: From Abusive Partner to Child Killer

Urfan Sharif travelled to the UK from Pakistan in 2003 on a student visa paid for by his father Mohamed's military pension. The plan was for Urfan to work and send money back to the family.

Working at a Burger King in 2007, he met 17-year-old 'Angelika'. After four years in the UK completing a Business Management course, Urfan knew time was running out to find someone to marry and secure his immigration status.

The pair began dating, and Angelika told the podcast that initially, Urfan treated her like 'a princess.'

'He was very wonderful in the beginning', she revealed.

'I felt very safe – he acted almost like a bodyguard. He knew where I was going. He called my friends to tell them to look after me. They would give him information about where I was, who I was talking to.

'I was young, I didn't see the red flags.'

By the winter of 2007, Angelika said the 'devil emerged in Urfan' as his paranoia turned violent.

Relaxing at home on a break from work, she alleges Urfan burst through the door and launched himself at her.

Pinned against the sofa, he held a knife at her throat, telling her: 'you're mine and only mine.'

Sara Sharif, 10, died in August 2023 after being subjected to 'unimaginable pain, misery and anxiety', a court previously heard

Urfan proceeded to punch Angelika in the face, steal her possessions and lock her inside the house.

Angelika reported the incident to Surrey police but decided against pursuing charges against him.

Jehring explained her reasons why: 'At this time, Angelika was in her late teens, living in a foreign country, with a limited grasp of English.

'Urfan was almost a decade older, and not only had he completely taken over her life – but he'd also managed to hoodwink her friends and family into thinking he was a decent man.

'This meant those closest to Angelika leant on her not to take things any further.'

Angelika returned to Urfan, became pregnant with his child, but later miscarried. Responding to the news, Urfan would again reveal his true colours.

'I was crying like a kid, and he told me, you had a f***ing abortion, you b****', Angelika said.

'Then, he punched me in the face – it was very painful, not only losing a child but having Urfan accuse me of having an abortion.'

After this incident, she left him and fled back to Poland, but Urfan pursued her. On this trip searching for Angelika, he would meet another woman, 21-year-old Olga Denim.

Olga was convinced to marry Urfan and accompany him to the UK, securing his immigration status.

'They were married quickly and started a family in the ensuing months', Jehring said.

'Social services were repeatedly called to the house. Urfan had gambling and drinking problems – and was fully removed from the family home at one point.

'It was against this toxic backdrop that Olga fell pregnant with their daughter - Sara Sharif.'
